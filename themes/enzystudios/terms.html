      <div class="post-title">
        <h3>1. Sessions Booking</h3> 
      </div>
      <p>Times and dates are subject to availability. ENZY Studios reserve the right to refuse and
        reschedule. Bookings can be made online or by person at the facility and are not valid until
        confirmed and deposit is paid.</p>
        <div class="post-title">
        <h3>2. Deposits & Cancellations</h3> 
      </div>
      <p>A 25% deposit is required to confirm all bookings of the studio and session musicians. The
        remaining cost will be paid at the end of the recording session. Failure to produce full payment will
        result in the studio withholding all copies of recordings, master or session files until all fees have 
        been paid and funds cleared. This includes payment due to breakages or missing items. Further 
        failure to pay will result in prosecution.</p>

       <p> If the client must cancel a session, we must be notified within 4 days of the scheduled date. In
        such circumstances, ENZY Studios must receive an email or call within the time frame and the
        session may be rescheduled. Please note, only one amendment can be made per booking. If
        a cancellation is made in less than 4 days of the scheduled session date then your deposit will
        be forfeit. If a client fails to attend a session this will be deemed as a cancellation and the deposit
        will be forfeit. There will be no refund in case the client leaves the session early.</p>
        <div class="post-title">

        <p>We will not release any reference material (CD’s, MP3’s or other) until the studio bill is paid. This 
          protects our investment in the project from clients that may take a reference CD and never return. 
          We will retain a proprietary interest in any and all work performed until such time as all charges 
          incurred are paid in full. In the unfortunate event that we incur costs to collect any sums lawfully 
          due, we shall be entitled to said costs, expenses and damages, including reasonable solicitor 
          fees, incurred in connection therewith.</p>
         <p>Any overdue accounts will be subject to interest charges of 2% per month.</p> 
         <p>Any claims for adjustments in connection with an invoice must be presented to ENZY Studios
          in writing within ten days from the date of the invoice in question. Customer hereby waives any
          claim for adjustment in billing which is not timely presented according to the provisions of this 
          paragraph.</p>
          <p style="font:bold 13px/58px Merriweather;">Additional Service Tax of 12.36% will be applied plus any additional taxes if applicable.</p>
